I have made a spin-of of my fairly widely use squash app 'Squore' to an app for Table Tennis. 
I know there are already several apps to do this, but as far as I know none of them have support for:
- Chrome Cast
- Graphs showing scoring history per game
- integration with tournamentsoftware.com
- Sharing results to have live scoring

Another plus is that this app is completely free and ad-free.

Suggestions are welcome.
