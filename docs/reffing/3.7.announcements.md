## Official announcements

If you like to make official announcements that should be made during a match, you can let the app help you.

## Micro button

By default, when appropriate a floating button with a microphone will appear.
If you press it, a dialog box with the appropriate announcement is displayed.

![Squore with End-Of-Match announcement"](../img/sb.main.14.match.end.announcement.png)

### Good to know

If you press the 'Microphone' floating button at the start of a new game, the app will record this moment as the start of the game.
So if you are interested in accurate timings, I suggest you use this button :-)
