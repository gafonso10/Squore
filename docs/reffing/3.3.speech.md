## Speech

For those who like that the app 'speaks' and announces the score, you can enable this option via _Settings/Speech_.

By default this option is set to _Don not use_.

### Suggest

If you set the speech preference to _Suggest_, a speech button will bevisiblee in the actionbar.
The app will say the score only when you press the button

### Automatic

If you set the speech preference to _Automatic_, the app will announce the score after each change in score.  
A speech button will be visible in the actionbar as well.
The app will say the score (again) when you press the button.

### Customize

The speech feature is implemented using text-to-speech from Google.
The only way to currently modify the speech is by adjusting either the _Pitch_ and/or the _Rate_ of the speech.

You can play around a little with values for these two in the _Settings_.
