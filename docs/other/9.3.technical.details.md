## Technical details

All details of a match is stored in JSON format into a file.

If desired you can post the entire json file to your club's website at the end of a match and use it as you see fit.

The json file with typically look like this:

    {
      "players": { "A": "James", "B": "Richard"},
      "result": "2-1",
      "when": {
        "date": "2015-02-20",
        "time": "22:15:05+01:00"
      },
      "format": {
        "useHandInHandOutScoring": false,
        "nrOfGamesToWinMatch": 2,
        "tiebreakFormat": "TwoClearPoints",
        "numberOfPointsToWinGame": 5
      },
      "score": [
        [ "R1--",
          "L2--",
          "R--1",
          "--ST",
          "--R2",
          "--YL",
          "-3L-",
          "R4--",
          "L5--"
        ],
        [ "R--1",
          "--R2",
          "-1L-",
          "R--3",
          "-2R-",
          "R--4",
          "--R5"
        ],
        [ "-1R-",
          "R2--",
          "L--1",
          "-3R-",
          "R4--",
          "L5--"
        ]
      ],
      "conductCalls": [],
      "timing": [
        {
          "offsets": [ 4, 15, 25, 44, 44, 54, 61, 67, 73 ],
          "start": "2015-02-20T22:15:05+01:00",
          "end": "2015-02-20T22:16:18+01:00"
        },
        {
          "offsets": [ 8, 19, 33, 51, 70, 81, 100 ],
          "start": "2015-02-20T22:17:30+01:00",
          "end": "2015-02-20T22:19:10+01:00"
        },
        {
          "offsets": [ 21, 55, 65, 72, 81, 91 ],
          "start": "2015-02-20T22:20:06+01:00",
          "end": "2015-02-20T22:21:37+01:00"
        }
      ]
    }

If you are interested: These json files are typically stored in `/data/data/com.doubleyellow.scoreboard/files` and have the `.sb` extension.
The file called `LAST.sb` is a special one: It is the match the app was last used for/the match in progress.

In the `timing` array there is one entry for each game. Per game there is the time `start` and `end` timestamps that are self-explaining.
In the `offsets` array there is one number per score line. The number is the number of seconds elapsed since the start of the game.

So for example the first point in the third game was score 21 seconds after the start of the game.
Since the start of the third game was `20150220-222006` the point was scored in the app at `20150220-222027`.
The second point of the third game was score 55 seconds after the start of the game: i.e. `20150220-222101`

## Flags

If you specify a country for a player, the corresponding flag is fetched 
from the squore server and before it is displayed.

If a flag has been fetched before it is stored on your device.
If you are going somewhere without internet and still want to be able to use flags, you have the option to 'prefetch' all image flags while you
still have an internet connection. You can do this via `Settings/Internet/Prefetch flag images`
