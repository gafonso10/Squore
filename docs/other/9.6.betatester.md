## Beta-Tester

To be able to test the beta version of the app you must become a beta tester:

In Google Play, 
go the the app, 
scroll to the bottom till the section 'Become a beta tester' and click "I'm In".

What should also work is just visit this URL:

<https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.doubleyellow.scoreboard>

It is always possible to opt out of being a beta tester in a similar way, 
may you wish to do so.
